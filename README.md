## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
 Fine-tuning my projects and my first developer portfolio â€“ showcasing my projects, skills, and journey so far.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
JavaScript best practices, accessibility, and how to build user-friendly, inclusive front-end applications.

ðŸ’¡ Why I started coding:
I aim to develop accessible, well-designed digital solutions that are easy to use, particularly for those who need them most. My long-term goal is to contribute to the improvement of digital tools and services within the healthcare system.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
Beginner-friendly frontend projects or anything related to clean UI, accessibility, and real-world problem solving.

âš¡ Fun fact:
I love organizing things â€” whether itâ€™s code or mountain adventures!
