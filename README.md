## Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on:
 Fine-tuning my projects and my first developer portfolio – showcasing my projects, skills, and journey so far:
	•	Powder Paths – a blog project that brings together frontend development and my passion for ski touring ❄️🏔️
	•	Square Eyes – an interactive online movie store built with JavaScript
	•	Community Cinema – a responsive HTML/CSS site promoting accessible local screenings

🌱 I’m currently learning:
JavaScript best practices, accessibility, and how to build user-friendly, inclusive front-end applications.

💡 Why I started coding:
I aim to develop accessible, well-designed digital solutions that are easy to use, particularly for those who need them most. My long-term goal is to contribute to the improvement of digital tools and services within the healthcare system.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
Beginner-friendly frontend projects or anything related to clean UI, accessibility, and real-world problem solving.

⚡ Fun fact:
I love organizing things — whether it’s code or mountain adventures!
